# AWAE-Preparation
This repository will contain all trainings and tutorials I have done/read to prepare for OSWE.

### Course Syllabus:
https://www.offensive-security.com/documentation/awae-syllabus.pdf

### Before AWAE:
I would not recommend taking the course before at least; finishing all SQL and XSS Injection challenges in bWAPP
https://sourceforge.net/projects/bwapp/files/bee-box/ and being able to understand and debug different languages like **C#, Php, Java, and Javascript**.

## Before The Exam:
**The Web Application Hacker's Handbook** is your friend. The negative part of AWAE course is that they did not include enough methodologies for vulnerability discovery, thus, I strongly recommend reading Chapter 21 from **The Web Application Hacker's Handbook** , and be comfortable debugging C#, Java, Php, and Javascript, using Burp Suite, dnSpy, JD-GUI, Visual Studio, and writing custom PoC in at least one language :).
